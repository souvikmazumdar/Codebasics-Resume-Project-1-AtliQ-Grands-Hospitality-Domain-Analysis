# Hospitality Analysis Dashboard:

## Problem Statement:
Throughout India, AtliQ Grands is the owner of several five-star hotels. They have spent the last twenty years working in the hotel sector. In the category of luxury/business hotels, AtliQ Grands is losing market share and income as a result of competitors' strategic initiatives and poor management decision-making. In order to recover their market share and revenue, the managing director of AtliQ Grands made the strategic decision to integrate "Business and Data Intelligence." They lack an internal data analytics team, though, therefore they are unable to receive these insights.

In order to obtain insights from their historical data, their revenue management team made the decision to work with a third-party service provider.


## Objective:
Providing a consolidated platform for stakeholders to track and evaluate important performance indicators is the aim of this extensive business insights dashboard.


In order to generate pertinent insights, support data-driven decision-making, spot patterns, and unearth useful information specifically designed for AtliQ Grand, metrics pertinent to the hotel sector are included.

## Industry Specific Metrics:

- #### Average Daily Rate (ADR):
  The percentage of revenue to all rooms sold or reserved,  a measurement of the typical price received for rooms sold over a specific duration.

- #### Realisation %:
  The percentage of successfully "checked out" reservations across all reservations.

- #### Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR):
  Regardless of whether a room is occupied, RevPAR shows the amount of money made per available room. It gauges revenue-generating efficiency to set hotel prices precisely. Hotels can assess their performance by comparing it to other properties or brands using RevPAR.

- #### Daily Booked Room Nights (DBRN):
  This indicator indicates the average number of rooms reserved for a given time frame in a given day.
- #### Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN):
  Taking a time period into account, this indicator indicates the average number of rooms that are available for sale in a given day.

- #### Daily Utilized Room Nights (DURN):
  Based on a time period, this indicator indicates the average number of rooms that guests successfully use in a given day.
